A year of solar power

The following noted will be turned into a presentation
in the near future

## Motivation

Documentary that told us we are killing Earth - Planet Earth II?
Reduce our impact on Earth
Show the map that shows how much of earth we need to cover in panels to power the planet
1kW per square meter? Average?

## 2022

Generated: 5144
Consumed: 3785
Imported: 1490
Exported: 1792
Battery: 1446

### Prices

Compare actual with:
- Averaging it out
- Using the Dec rates

Combine this with generated / consumed etc each month
Graph it out

|Month|Import|Export|
|Jan|20.35|20|
|Feb|20.35|18|
|Mar|20.35|19.6|
|Apr|20.35|28|
|May|28.08|12.37|
|Jun|28.08|15.49|
|Jul|28.08|21.85|
|Aug|28.08|29.97|
|Sep|28.08|34.44|
|Oct|33.63|12.11|
|Nov|33.63|13.21|
|Dec|33.63|34.67|

### Value

Calculate how much was saved each month
by direct use and by battery (and then total).

Calculate payback. Mention saving periods too.
Mention EV?

### CO2 and other impact

Work this out for the UK mix

### Requirements
- Roof area, aspect
- Planning permission
- Export agreement

### Equipment

Discuss how to choose each

- 12 panels rated at 385W each
- 7.2kWh battery
- 3.6kWh inverter
- Micro generation certification 
- Pigeon proofing!
- Lifetime - panel degradation, inverter replacement 
- Cost (vat), added to house value, prices have now gone up

Discuss best days (30+ units), 
worst days (0.4 units), surprising (v hot, 3kW limit))

### Installation
- One day, 3 people
- All in attic, cable to distribution box and export meter

### Impact on life
- Make hay when the sun shines!
- Reduce quiescent usage to a minimum
  - Turning off lights, NAS, standby mode
- More efficient tumble dryer
